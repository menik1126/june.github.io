Hi! My name is Jing Xiong (熊璟), and I am currently a third-year graduate student at the School of Intelligent Systems Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/) and Prof. Chengming Li. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Central South University in 2021.

I am currently a research intern at Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab. My research interests primarily include natural language processing, complex reasoning based on language models, and formal theorem proving. I am also interested in analyzing and understanding the reasoning capabilities of neural networks using classic machine learning techniques, such as information bottleneck, influence function, and low-rank decomposition method, etc. If you are also interested in the above-mentioned topics, please feel free to contact me!

During my internship at the Noah's Ark Lab, I had the opportunity to learn from [Dr. Zhengying Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DFme0joAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Dr. Jianhao Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9fppVAUAAAAJ&hl=en). I acquired knowledge in interactive theorem prover Lean and Metamath with a foundation in ZFC set theory. Under the guidance of Dr. Zhengying Liu, I contributed to the development of a prototype theorem verification environment for language models. Additionally, I gained insights into structural prediction from [Dr. Zhijiang Guo](https://cartus.github.io/). As a core member under the leadership of [Dr. Yichun Yin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x3Mz21gAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. Guo Zhijiang, I actively participated in the development of the PanGu Manifacture Large Model for the OptVerse AI Solver project. This project successfully made its debut at the Huawei HDC 2023 keynote session, and I was honored with the title of "The Star of Manifacture Large Model" in the 2012 Lab.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
